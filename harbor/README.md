# Harbor

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.

## For self-signed certificate

download the registry's certificate, and copy it to `/etc/docker/certs.d/harbor.example.com/ca.crt`
