# Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. A Helm chart is a package format for defining, installing, and upgrading Kubernetes applications.

## Helm chart

A Helm chart is a collection of files which describe a Kubernetes application and its dependencies, and it can be versioned, shared, and reused by others.
Typically, a Helm chart includes a set of YAML files that define Kubernetes resources as well as templates that allow for customization of the resources.
