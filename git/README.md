## Git Flow

Git flow is a Git branching strategy which designed to simplify release management. In the Git Flow, there are five branch types:

```txt
main: production-ready code

develop: latest delivered development changes for the next release

feature: new feature development

release: prepare for a new production release

hotfix: fix a bug in production code
```
