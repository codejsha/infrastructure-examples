## Overview

This project is configuration examples of infrastructure software. Each software can be part of an infrastructure architecture. Although this repository does not include all relevant configurations, you can use a few examples to configure the architecture you want. In a cloud environment, declarative approaches under *Infrastructure as code (IaC)* enable efficient and fast configurations. Using appropriate tools can reduce boilerplate codes and repetitive tasks.

highly recommend the following useful tools:

- VM infra: `Ansible`, `PSSH`
- Cloud infra: `Terraform`
- Kubernetes infra: `Helm`, `Operator`, `Krew`
