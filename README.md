# Infrastructure Examples

## Overview

This project is configuration examples of infrastructure software. Each software can be part of an infrastructure architecture. Although this repository does not include all relevant configurations, you can use a few examples to configure the architecture you want.

In cloud environment, declarative approaches under *Infrastructure as code (IaC)* enable efficient and fast configurations. Using appropriate tools can reduce boilerplate codes and repetitive tasks.

highly recommend the following useful tools:

- VM infra: Ansible, PSSH
- Cloud infra: Terraform
- Kubernetes infra: Helm, Krew

and the following tools/commands in linux:

- `vscode`(remote), `curl`, `jq`, `perl`, `find`, `xargs`, `fzf`, `set`, `envsubst`, `&`(background process)
