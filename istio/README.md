# Istio

Istio is an open-source service mesh platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
Traffic routing rules let you easily control the flow of traffic and API calls between services.
It provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services: traffic management, service identity and security, and observability and telemetry
